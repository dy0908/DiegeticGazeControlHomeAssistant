  By not providing "Findros2_aruco.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "ros2_aruco", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "ros2_aruco" with
  any of the following names:

    ros2_arucoConfig.cmake
    ros2_aruco-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "ros2_aruco" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "ros2_aruco_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "ros2_aruco" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
