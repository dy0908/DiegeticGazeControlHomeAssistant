[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:16 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findros2_aruco_interfaces.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
  this project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided
  by "ros2_aruco_interfaces", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "ros2_aruco_interfaces" with any of the following names:

    ros2_aruco_interfacesConfig.cmake
    ros2_aruco_interfaces-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "ros2_aruco_interfaces" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "ros2_aruco_interfaces_DIR" to a directory containing one of the
  above files.  If "ros2_aruco_interfaces" provides a separate development
  package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
